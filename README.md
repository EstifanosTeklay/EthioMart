Overview: EthioMart aims to become Ethiopia's premier centralized hub for e-commerce
activities on Telegram. Given the widespread use of Telegram for business, EthioMart seeks to
consolidate multiple independent Telegram channels into a unified platform, enabling easier
product discovery and communication between vendors and customers. The project involves
fine-tuning a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for extracting entities like product names,
prices, and locations from Amharic messages.
Business Need: Currently, vendors and customers are distributed across various Telegram
channels, leading to inefficiency in managing multiple platforms. EthioMart will address this by
centralizing real-time data from various Telegram e-commerce channels, providing a unified,
streamlined user experience for e-commerce in Ethiopia.
The technical focus of this project is fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for the Amharic
language to improve entity recognition, ultimately facilitating better data organization for
EthioMart's database.
